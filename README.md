# Google Santa Tracker for Web

This repository contains the code to [Google Santa Tracker](https://santatracker.google.com), an educational and entertaining tradition for the December holiday period.
It is a companion to the [Android](https://github.com/google/santa-tracker-android) app.

# Supports

Santa Tracker supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge; it also supports IE11, Safari 10+ and Chromium-based browsers (Opera, Samsung etc) at m44 or above.

# Run

You'll need `yarn` or `npm`.
On any platform but macOS or Linux, you'll also need Java.

Clone the project, run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn start` to bring up a development server.
Compilation of scenes, CSS etc is done via middleware at serve time: if you're interested, see the `-transform.js` files in this directory.

## Build and Release

Santa Tracker is served entirely with static resources, so unlike development, every file must be compiled at once.
TODO(samthor): finish this part.

# Development Guide

Santa Tracker is usees a core 'App Shell' model, as well as individual scenes.
These scenes can typically be run on their own, as well as part of the whole.

## New Scene

To add a new scene, you'll need to update some locations.

1. The [`scenes.js`](scenes.js) file is the master definition for all scenes.
   It contains details about each scene's colors, rotation, category, strings etc.
2. Every scene should have associated PNG assets.
   * `images/scenes/sceneName_2x.png` (950x564) and `sceneName_1x.png` (475x282)
   * `images/scenes/sceneName_og.png` (1333x1000)

## JavaScript

Santa Tracker generates JavaScript that is modified from its original source.

* There are some special template tags, which are compiled away.
  1. ``_msg`msgid_here`​`` is replaced with the translated string contents
  2. ``_style`style_name`​`` is replaced with the compiled style file from within `/styles`

* Non-relative ES module imports, those importing `node_modules`, are translated to their actual paths (e.g. `import '@polymer/...';`)

## Translations

Santa Tracker contains translations for a variety of different languages.
These translations are sourced from Google's internal translation tool.

If you're adding a string for development, please modify `en_src_messages.json`.
If you'd building Santa Tracker for production, you'll need the string to be translated and the final output contained within `lang/`.
